These notebooks with require an installation of [ArcGIS Pro](https://apps.itpals.vt.edu/arcgis/ArcGIS_Pro_Installation_Instructions.pdf) and Anaconda with a class environment.

#### Anaconda installation instructions
* [Download and install the software](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).  It's free, and can install on Windows, Linux, and Mac.
* The default installation of Anaconda comes with numpy, Pandas, matplotlib, and many other useful packages.  However, it does not come with many geospatial packages.  Installation of these can sometimes be challenging.  There are two main ways to do it.  First, you can use Anaconda's package manager conda to do it.  Or, you can use pip, Python's primary installer.  Both have benefits and drawbacks.  However, we'll use conda to do most of it.
